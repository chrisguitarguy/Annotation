Annotation
==========

A little PHP library for parse PHP docblock "annotations"

Example:

    /**
     * This is a docblock.
     *
     * @ThisIsAnAnnotation(argument=2)
     */
     class AClass
     {
        // ...
     }

Goals
~~~~~

* Self-contained
* No nested annotation parsing
* Annotations that are not "registered" as ignored
